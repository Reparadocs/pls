pls is Django setup made easy. Pls is a command line utility that creates a new Django project for you and sets it up with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and RDS so that you can start building immediately! Pls spins up micro instances by default so it will fall into the AWS free tier (of course this can be scaled up if you want).

Usage 'pls init NAME' to initialize a Django project - follow prompts and your project should be up and running in 5 minutes!
